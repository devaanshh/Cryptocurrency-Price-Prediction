# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction
We took 15 crypto currencies to analyse and then study them using python to be able to predict that which coin would be the best to invest in the future based on the inferences brought from the factors like opening and closing price, high and low values & market cap and volume of the considered currency. Thereforth, we shall predict the future price of the same coin after using the opertations of statistical and logical analysis.
